;   - MaxAllowedContentLength specifies the maximum allowed
;     numeric value of the Content-Length request header.  For
;     example, setting this to 1000 would cause any request
;     with a content length that exceeds 1000 to be rejected.
;     The default is 30000000.
;
;   - MaxUrl specifies the maximum length of the request URL,
;     not including the query string. The default is 260 (which
;     is equivalent to MAX_PATH).
